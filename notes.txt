                       - if both values are different then output is 1
                       - if both values are same then output is 0
            -> ~ (NOT) (tilde) - Inverts the bits (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0)
            -> << (Left Shift)

                execute the block of code
            
            -> while loop - runs block of code, as long as the condition is true
            
            -> do-while loop - similar to while, but run the code at least once, 
                even before checking the condition

                -> LaptopWeight = 1.5 -> double  laptopWeight = 1.5;
                -> LaptopModel = MACBOOK AIR -> String laptopModel = "MACBOOK AIR";

            -> Behavior - Methods (Task)

                -> Laptop can browse -> public void browseWeb() {} 
                -> Laptop can play videos -> public void playVideos() {} 
                -> Laptop can do some task -> public void doTask() {} 

        -> Laptop, Person, Anything can be an Object

        -> To Create an Object ? 
            We need Class ?

        -> Class ?

            -> Blueprint of Object

        -> Object 

            -> Real instance of an class

        -> Methods

        -> Data (Variables) we can represent them in 

            -> Class Level -> Instance Variables
            -> Inside Methods -> Local Variables
            -> Using Static keyword -> Static Variables


30th July
=========

    -> Instance Variables

        -> Declared inside a class, but outside the method and not Static
        -> Belong to each object
        -> Memory is allocated when an object is created
        -> can have default values, if not initialized

    -> Local Variables

        -> Declared inside a method, Constructors or Blocks
        -> Only accessible within method, Constructors or Blocks, in which 
            its's Declared
        -> Must be initialized before use 

    -> Static Variables

        -> Belong to class, not individual Objects
        -> Only one copy exists, meaning shared across all Objects
        -> Accessed using class name 
        -> Initialized Only once, at the time of class loading  

    -> Methods

        -> Method is a block of code that performs a TASK / ACTION

        -> Method Declaration

            -> Method Header

=========

    -> LMS With Classes, Objects & Methods.


1st Aug
=======

-> Constructors

-> Method - Block of code that performs some TASK

-> Constructor - Block of code that performs OBJECT initialization

    -> Constructor is a special method, that initializes newly
        created objects

    -> Method is called, after creating object
        -> Explicitly call method

    -> Constructor is called, at the time of object creation
        -> Implicitly called, while object is being created

    -> Constructors will not have any return type, not even void

    -> method name can be your choice, but Constructor name should
        be class name only    

    -> Default Constructor

        public ConstructorDemo(){    
        
        }

    -> Parameterized Constructor
        
        public ConstructorDemo(datatype parametersNames, ...){    
        
        }
    
    -> this - keyword refers to current instance of class

4th Aug
=======

-> Constructor Overloading

    -> Having Multiple Constructors(for different types of
    initializations), with different parameters
        -> Number of parameters
        -> Type of parameters
        -> Order of parameters
    
    -> Constructor() {

    -> Constructor(double a, double b) {

       }
    
    -> Constructor(int a, double b) {

       }

    -> Constructor(double a, int b) {

       }
    
-> this() - Constructor call

    -> Used to call a Constructor inside another Constructor

-> NOTE : this is keyword, used to refer current instance

5th Aug
=======

-> Variable - If you want to store data we need a variable

-> Datatype - Specifies what type of value a variable can hold

    -> int num = 10;

-> In general, a variable can hold only One Value at a time.

    -> int studentScore = 90; Valid
    -> int studentScores = 90,80,75; Invalid 

    -> If you want to Store Multiple Values for 
    a single variable then we need ARRAYS

-> Arrays - A data Structure thats holds Multiple Values for 
    a single variable with SAME DATA TYPES, and FIXED SIZE

    -> Types Of Arrays

        -> Single Dimensional Array
        -> Multi Dimensional Array

    -> In a graph, how we have x and y axis, in arrays we can apply
    the same concept, to represent data

-> Single Dimensional Array

    -> If we have only a single dimension (only X axis), then its
    a Single Dimensional Array

    -> Each element is Accessed using an Index(Position) 
        (starting from Zero (0) ) 

    -> Create array using 

        datatype[] arrayName = new datatype[size];

        int[] arrayName = {1,2,3,4,5};


-> Multi Dimensional Array 

    -> If we have multiple dimension (like X axis & Y axis), then its
    a Multi Dimensional Array

    // 2D Array
    -> datatype[][] arrayName = new datatype[size][size];

    // 3D Array
    -> datatype[][][] arrayName = new datatype[size][size][size];

7th Aug
=======

    -> LMS with Arrays

    -> Strings In Java

-> String - A sequence of characters

-> String msg = "Java";

-> String is non-primitive data type

-> String class and every string we create, is an
    object of string class

-> Strings are called Literals, as they possess
 unique behavior.

    -> When we create an object of string class,
     directly we can assign the value and prints the
     value directly

    -> When it comes to other classes, unlike Strings
    when we print the object, it give object address

-> String Pool 

    -> data = "hello" -> size
    -> bk_data = "hello" -> size


8th Aug
=======

    -> String Immutability

        -> Once a string is created, it cannot be modified

    -> NOTE - When you modify a string, like using concat(), 
        every time a new object is created, this leads to
        performance issues

    -> To overcome this, java has provided two classes to get Mutable Strings

        -> StringBuffer (Thread Safe)
        -> StringBuilder (Non-Thread Safe)

    -> LMS App With Strings    

11th Aug

-> Static vs Non-Static 

    -> First We need to be clear with Classes & Object

        -> Class - Blue Print Of an Object

            -> Variables, Data types, Constructors, Objects

                -> We can also add Blocks (Static & Non-Static) 
    
    -> In Java To Allocate Memory

        -> Using new keyword create an object and memory will be allocated

        -> Using static keyword also memory is allocated

12th Aug
========

    -> Instances Variables - Done
    -> Static Variables - Done
    -> Static Methods - Acts On Static Data
    -> Instance Methods - Acts On Instance Data

    -> static blocks - To initialize static variables

    -> instance blocks - To initialize non-static variables

    -> Constructors internally call non-static or instance blocks

    -> Main method is the starting point of execution, unless a static block is used

13th Aug
========

-> OOPS Principles

-> Inheritance

    -> Inheritance allows one class to inherit traits from another class

        -> Inherit Properties(Variables) & Methods

    -> One who inherits is called Child Class
    -> One who gives the Properties & Methods is called as Parent Class

    -> Child can inherit Parent, but not vice versa

    -> Inheritance is achieved by creating a Relationship between classes

        -> Relationship between classes is done using extends keyword

        -> Child will extends Parent

    -> With Inheritance

        -> Code Reusability
        -> No Code Duplication i.e No Repeatability
        -> Project Size is Less as Code is Less
        -> Code Reliability Increases
        -> Code Maintainability Improved

    -> Types Of Inheritance

        -> Single Level Inheritance

            -> A class inherits from another single class only

            -> A extends B 
                A -> B (Guest -> VideoAdmin)

        -> Multi Level Inheritance

            -> A class inherits from another class, which inturn inherits from
                another class

            -> A extends B and B extends C 
                A -> B -> C  (Guest -> VideoAdmin -> SuperAdmin)


        -> Hierarchal Level Inheritance

            -> Multiple Classes Inherit from Same Super Class

                       A

                B   C     D   E

                                Guest 

            -> VideoAdmin -> ContentReviewer -> Teacher

        -> Multiple Inheritance

            -> One Class inherits from two or more classes (NOT OK)

            -> One Class inherits from two or more Interfaces (OK)

            -> Multiple Inheritance is not supported with Classes

            -> Multiple Inheritance is supported with Interfaces

                -> Classes - A class is a Blueprint for an object
                -> Interfaces - An interface is a Blueprint for a class
                -> Interfaces have special methods we call them as abstract methods

                    -> Concrete Methods - Concrete methods have implementation

                    -> Abstract Methods - Abstract methods don't have implementation

                -> When Working with Interfaces, we use keyword implements 

        -> Hybrid Level Inheritance

            -> Combination of at least two types of Inheritance
                 Single + Multiple or Multilevel

                        A
                    B       C
                        D

    -> super keyword, is used to refer the parent class members

        -> methods, variables, constructors 
        -> differentiate between members of subclass and members with
        same name in super class

-> Access Modifiers

    -> These are keywords, which controls visibility of class members

    -> If we get an understanding of Access Modifiers, Encapsulation will be easy
        to understand.

    -> We Have Following Access Modifiers

        -> Public
        -> Private
        -> Protected
        -> Default

    -> NOTE : If you understand access modifiers will using variables, the same concept
        is extends to other members as well, with only slight difference for Classes
            (Mainly for top level classes)
            -> Top level classes only support public and default



-> Encapsulation

    -> Encapsulation describes the ability of an object, to hide
    it's data(variables) from rest of the world.

    -> If you take a class, what it does ?

        Class binds variables, methods, constructors, blocks etc 

16th Aug
========

    -> Encapsulation Demo

    -> Using Encapsulation means

        -> Declaring all the data i.e variables as Private
        -> Providing getters and setters methods to access and modify private variable

    
20th Aug
========

-> Abstraction - Hiding implementation and showing only the essential features of an object.

-> To work with Abstraction, we need to know about

    -> Interfaces
    -> Abstract Classes

-> A class is a Blueprint for an object

-> Interfaces 
    
    -> An interface is a Blueprint for a class

    -> Interfaces have special methods we call them as abstract methods
            -> Abstract Methods - Abstract methods don't have implementation
    
    -> Interfaces have only constants (Static Final Variables)

    -> An interface is like a Contract, which means you are bind by Contract

    -> Till Java 7, this is how Interfaces Worked, only abstract methods no implementations

        -> From Java 8, we got new updates in interfaces

            -> You you can something called as default methods 

21st Aug
========

-> Abstract Classes
            
    -> We know what is Concrete class - Concrete Methods
    -> We know what is Interface - Abstract Methods

-> we use a keyword called abstract when creating abstract classes

-> Abstract Class Contains

    -> Abstract Methods - without body

    -> Concrete Methods - with body

    -> Rules For Abstract Classes

        -> We cannot create an object for abstract class

        -> We can have concrete methods in abstract classes

        -> If we have multiple abstract classes like interfaces,
            we cannot get multiple Inheritance

            -> class implements Inter_A, Inter_B - Okay

            -> class extends AbsClass_A, AbsClass_B - Not Okay

25th Aug
========    

-> Polymorphism 

    -> Poly - Multiple
    -> Morph - Form

    -> In Java, Polymorphism enables a single entity(Operator, Object, Method) to take multiple forms

    -> Types Of Polymorphism

        -> Compile Time Polymorphism

            -> Occurs during compilation phase -> Method Overloading

                -> Number of Parameters
                -> Type of Parameters
                -> Order of Parameters

        -> Runtime Time Polymorphism

            -> Occurs during execution/runtime phase -> Method Overriding

            -> Method Overriding : Providing your own implementation, for the derived 
                implementation from parent class
